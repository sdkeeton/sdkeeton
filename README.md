Hello there! I'm Spencer Keeton, a relatively-recent graduate (May 2021) from Grand Valley State University.

*I am currently on the job hunt, so if you happen to be looking for an entry-level employee for any CS jobs (preferrably Software Development, but I'm open to a lot in the CS field), feel free to reach out!*


This repository contains a lot of random work done worked on by me (both my own & collaborations with others).
Currently, it's just some school projects, but I am looking to add more projects here in the future!

I have some lower-level experience with quite a few languages, but the one's I'm more drawn to work with (and have more knowledge of) are Java & JavaScript (along with JS frameworks). While I expand my knowledge further with Java & JS, I am also looking to learn new languages, and I will be getting into some more as time goes on. So, there will probably be some experimentation on this repository!
